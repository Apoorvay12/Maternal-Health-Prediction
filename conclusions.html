            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>

            Maternal mortality remains a significant global challenge, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare resources. The inability to predict and prevent complications during pregnancy often leads to adverse outcomes for both mothers and newborns. To combat this issue, the Maternal Health Prediction project seeks to develop a predictive model capable of assessing maternity health risks based on key physiological indicators.
          <br>
          <br>
            Key Inputs:
            <br>
            The predictive model takes six essential inputs into account:
           <br>
           <br>
            Age<br>
            Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)<br>
            Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)<br>
            Blood Sugar Level<br>
            Heart Rate<br>
            Other relevant health metrics<br>
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="random-forest">
            <h2>Expected Impact</h2>
            <p>
             The Maternal Health Prediction project has the potential to significantly impact maternal healthcare outcomes by providing early risk identification and intervention strategies. By accurately predicting maternity health risks, healthcare providers can prioritize resources and interventions for high-risk individuals, thereby reducing maternal mortality rates and improving overall maternal and neonatal health outcomes.

            <h2>Future Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                In the future, we plan to expand the capabilities of our project by incorporating real-time data collection through surveys on our website. By integrating features to gather real-time health data from pregnant individuals, we aim to continuously augment our dataset and enhance the predictive accuracy of our machine learning model.
            <br>
            <br>
                Additionally, we intend to implement mechanisms to feed this real-time data into our machine learning model, enabling dynamic updates and improvements over time. By leveraging feedback loops between data collection, model training, and prediction, we seek to iteratively strengthen our model's predictive capabilities and refine its performance in predicting maternity health risks.
            <br>
            <br>
                Collaborating with healthcare professionals and domain experts, we also plan to conduct rigorous validation studies to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive model in real-world settings. By integrating user feedback and iteratively refining our model, we aspire to develop a robust and scalable solution that can positively impact maternal healthcare outcomes on a global scale.
